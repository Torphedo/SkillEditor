"\nSkill Editor will automatically connect to Phantom Dust as quickly as it can. Sometimes the editor will connect to the game faster than the fraction of a second it takes for the skill data to be loaded. If you reboot the game or open it after the editor, you may have to click \"Refresh process\" once to get the skill data to load. You may also have to click the reload button in the text editor after a refresh. For more information, read the Syncing page.",
"\nBy design, the editor feels like it edits the game state directly. In reality, Skill Editor maintains its own complete copy of all skill data, which is automatically sent to the game within 1 frame of it changing (as fast as the UI reflects it). Usually the game never changes data, so the two are always in sync. But sometimes (usually after reboots), the game's data will change and make the editor out of sync. The editor automatically tries to resync when it sees a game reboot, but if that doesn't work, you can manually trigger one with the \"Refresh process\" button.",
"\nTo distribute one or more skills in a single file, click `File > New Skill Pack` (or press `N`) and select all the skill files you want to include.\nThe name you enter will be saved inside the file, but won't be visible to people who install it (for now). Once you enter a name, hit save and choose a location to save the file.",
"\nThe Text Editor can be accessed from `Window > Text Edit`. Here, you can edit the name and description of the currently selected skill. There is no limitation on the length of the name, aside from whether it'll run off the end of the box in-game. When you save a skill or combine saved skills into a pack, the current name and description are also saved."
