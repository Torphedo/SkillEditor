"\nSkill Editor can't correctly connect to Phantom Dust until the skill data & text has been loaded. If it tries to connect before the main menu screen loads in, the UI will freeze for a few seconds while it tries to search through about 8GB of address space. Since it will attempt a connection when booting up, it might also take longer to start if the game hasn't loaded the data yet. To keep things running quickly, don't try to use any of the memory read/write features until the game has reached the main menu.",
"\nTo distribute one or more skills in a single file, click `File > New Skill Pack` and select all the skill files you want to distribute.\nThe name you enter will be saved inside the file, but won't be visible to people who install it (for now). Once you enter a name, hit save and choose a location to save the file.",
"\nThe Text Editor can be accessed from `Window > Text Edit`. The IDs displayed do not match the ones seen in-game, so you may have to search a bit to find the one you're looking for. The input boxes won't let you input text longer than the original string, for now. The allowed length for a piece of text may suddenly become shorter if you reboot the program or switch to another skill's text after writing a shorter string to memory, so be careful. You might need to reboot. Text can't be saved into skill packs yet, but it should be possible soon."
