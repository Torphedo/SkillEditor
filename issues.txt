- open by ID uses decimal IDs, forcing the user to manually convert from internal hex IDs
- No searchable/scrollable list of skill names available
- Byte limitations are annoying when data shifts around
- Dash, Lift Up, Skywalk, etc. (any skill that moves you) will be extremely loud
  with large movement values (needs in-editor warning)
- Closing Skill Editor while it's frozen via debugging will close the game too
